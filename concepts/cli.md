Cross-Platform (xPlat) CLI
==========================

The CLI syntax is always of the form

```bash
$ azure <noun-phrase> <verb> <arguments>
```

The noun-phrase is one or more ordered words that uniquely describe the 
particular Azure feature to be used.

The verb is drawn from the following:
* list
* create
* show
* set
* delete
