Gateways
========
A virtual network always has an implicit default gateway that connects
it to the public Internet and provides NAT.  However, if you want to
connect securely to an on-premises network, or to another vnet, you must
go through a VPN Gateway.  This is a common scenario for large enterprises,
who want to form a hybrid cloud, and to distribute their virtual resources
in order to provide high availability and disaster recovery.

The design and management of such complex network topologies are outside
the scope of an introduction such as this.
