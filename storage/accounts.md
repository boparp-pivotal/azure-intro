Storage Accounts
================
Storage is one of the oldest and most versatile services the Azure portfolio.
In remaining backwards-compatible over time, and serving many masters, though,
it also can appear complex and arbitrary, full of exceptions and special cases.

## Accounts
To use the service, you must first create one or more storage accounts 
within your subscription.  By default, such an account is general purpose.
There are also specialized account types, optimized for specific scenarios.
However, these also impose certain low-level constraints.  It's important
to be aware of these constraints when you create the accounts, as the
account type cannot be changed after creation.
